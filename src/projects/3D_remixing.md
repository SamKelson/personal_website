description: "3D Printing a Remixed Cable Organizer"
---

## Introduction
In this project, I explored the process of remixing 3D files to create novel 3D prints by modifying existing models and combining different designs for new functionality. Using CAD tools like Tinkercad and Autodesk Fusion, I imported a [publicly available 3D model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4746510) and transformed it into a customized cable organizer by adding new features to improve its usability. This experience strengthened my ability to edit and remix digital designs, equipping me with the skills to leverage 3D printing and CAD software for creative problem-solving in engineering and design challenges.
## Initial Sketch

## Setup on Tinkercad

After sketching and getting a basic idea of what I wanted to remix about the initial design. I attempted to import the initial STL file into Tinkercad. This is where I ran into my first roadblock. The STL file that I had got was too large to be uploaded to Tinkercad directly. To fix this
